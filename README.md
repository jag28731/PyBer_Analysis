# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project
Maria and her supervisor were notified by the school board of academic dishonesty for Thomas High School ninth graders.
  
### Purpose
The purpose of my analysis was to conduct a school grade audit and visually show whether or not dishonesty has occurred. The school board does not know the full extent of the dishonesty, so I have been tasked with replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs. I will repeat the school district analysis and write a report of how these changes affected the analysis. 

## Pyber Analysis Results
Maria has tasked me to analyze academic scores to determine academic dishonesty. I was able replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs and rerun the school district analysis to determine the overall change. 

### Results
- How is the district summary affected?

  After running the analysis, the district school summary was affected slightly.  After replacing Thomas High School 9th grade scores for reading and math, the average math       score went down .1%, the average reading score remained the same, the percent passing math went down .2%, the percent passing reading went down .1%, and the overall passing     went down .3%.
