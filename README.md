# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project
V. Isualize has given Omar and myself a brand-new assignment. We wil create a summary dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, we will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
  
### Purpose
The purpose of my analysis was to was to create a dataframe and multi-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. This project will allow V. Isualize to visually see the how much each city made on a weekly basis. 

## Pyber Analysis Results
V. Isualize has given Omar and myself a project to determine the weekly fares amount by city type. Below are the results of our analysis.  

### Results
Results by city type:
- Rural: Rural has the least amount of rides and drivers but the average fare price for the rides and drivers is the highest. Rural had 125 rides,	78 drivers, $4,327.93	total fares,	$34.62 average ride cost and	$55.49 fare per driver.
- Suburban: Suburban was the middle of the pack for rides, drivers, and average fare price for rides and drivers. Suburban had 625 rides,	490 drivers, $19,356.33 total fares, $30.97 average ride cost and	$39.50 fare per driver.
- Urban: Urban had the most amount of rides and drivers but the lowest average fare price for the rides and drivers. Urban had 1625 rides,	2405 drivers,	$39,854.38 total fares, $24.53 average ride cost and	$16.57 fare per driver. 
 
In the end, rural ranked lowest in rides/drivers but the average fare cost was the highest. Urban ranked the highest in rides/drivers but the average fare cost was the lowest. The city type that brought in the most money was the Urban city type.

## Pyber Analysis Summary
Recommendations based on analysis. 
1.	Urban city type provides the most business. The amount of rides was less than drivers so a decrease in drivers could increase the average fare per driver.
2.	Rural city type has the least amount of business but the rides cost more. The rides could be a farther distance so an increase in drivers could handle the call volume better, however that may decrease the average fare per drivers.
3.	March and April have the highest fares cost. I would increase the drivers to handle the workload during those times.
